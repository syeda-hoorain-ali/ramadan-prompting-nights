## 🧩 What Is This Challenge?

Every night at **10 PM PKT** throughout Ramadan 2026, a new coding scenario unlocked on the platform. The goal was **not** to write code directly — but to write a structured AI prompt precise enough that an LLM would generate a correct and efficient JavaScript function that passed hidden test cases.

**30 nights. 30 challenges. One prompt per night.**

## 🧠 Scoring System

Each submission was scored out of **100 points** across three components:

| Component | Points | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompt Quality** | 60 | All 4 required sections present (15 pts each) |
| **Prompt Depth** | +20 | Linear ramp, maxes out at ≥200 characters |
| **Specificity** | +20 | Keyword hits: `must` `should` `avoid` `handle` `return` `input` `output` |
| **Correctness** | 20 | Generated code passes all hidden test cases |
| **Efficiency** | 20 | Fewer tokens in generated code = higher score |

### Required Prompt Structure

```markdown
**Goal:** what the function should do
**Constraints:** rules the code must follow
**Edge Cases:** special inputs to handle
**Output Format:** exact return format expected
```

## 🔥 The Hard Days (21–30)

The final 10 days had a hidden layer of complexity — several challenges had a **mismatch between the API spec and the test runner**. The platform's test runner expected a completely different function signature than what the challenge description showed:

| Day | API Says | Runner Actually Tests |
|---|---|---|
| 22 | `revalidatePlan` | `curry` |
| 23 | `queueRetryPlan` | `promisePool` |
| 24 | `notificationBatch` | `LRUCache` class |
| 25 | `optimizeLeaderboardQueryPlan` | `EventEmitter` factory |
| 27 | `realtimeMergeState` | `buildTrie` + `search` |
| 28 | `secureUploadCheck` | `rateLimiter` closure |

Most students (including me at first) dropped off at Day 22 after repeatedly hitting `curry is not defined` errors. Cracking each of these required reading the actual test runner source code, understanding how the background code interacted with user submissions, and reverse-engineering what the runner truly expected — then crafting a prompt that generated exactly that.

## 📁 Structure

Each `day-XX.md` file contains:

- **Challenge** — the original scenario and problem statement
- **My Prompt** — the structured prompt I submitted
- **Generated Code** — the JavaScript function AI produced
- **Score Breakdown** — tokens, attempts, final score, leaderboard position at that point
- **Prompt History** — all attempts made that night
- **Background Code** — the hidden test harness (reverse-engineered)

If you're a student who gave up on Day 22 — go back. The hard days aren't broken, they're just harder. Read the source code, understand the runner, and try again. Every day in this challenge is solvable.
